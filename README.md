# snowflake-churn-warehouse
ustomer Churn Analytics & ML Scoring Platform
Snowflake · Python · Power BI · AWS

An end-to-end customer churn analytics platform that mirrors real-world data science and analytics engineering workflows.
The system ingests raw data, performs warehouse-native transformations, trains and scores an ML model, and delivers executive and operational dashboards in Power BI.

Business Problem
Customer churn directly impacts revenue.
This project enables stakeholders to:

Understand who is churning and why
Quantify churn drivers (contract, tenure, pricing)
Identify high-risk customers using ML probability scores
Act using BI dashboards backed by warehouse-native logic
Architecture Overview
End-to-End Data Flow

AWS Context (Production-Realistic)
Snowflake account is deployed on AWS

All warehouse compute and storage operate on AWS infrastructure

Pipeline design mirrors common AWS architectures:

Optional AWS S3 landing zone for raw file ingestion

Snowflake external stages for cloud-native loading

Transformations and analytics remain warehouse-first

Tech Stack
Data & Processing

Python 3.13

DuckDB (local SQL profiling & validation)

Pandas, NumPy

Data Warehouse

Snowflake (RAW → STG → ANALYTICS schemas)

Warehouse-native quality checks

BI-ready semantic views

Machine Learning

scikit-learn pipeline

Logistic Regression

Metrics tracked:

ROC AUC

PR AUC

Optimized decision threshold

Business Intelligence

Power BI (direct connection to Snowflake)

Executive + operational dashboards

Cloud Platform

AWS (Snowflake-hosted deployment)

Optional S3-based ingestion pattern

Data Model (Snowflake)
Core Tables

V\_CHURN\_BY\_TENURE\_BUCKET

V\_CHURN\_BY\_MONTHLY\_CHARGE\_BAND

These views provide a clean semantic layer for Power BI without duplicating logic.

Machine Learning Workflow
Feature extraction from Snowflake analytics schema

Train / test split

Pipeline:

One-hot encoding

Logistic regression

Threshold optimization using PR/F1 tradeoff

Write-back to Snowflake:

Model metadata

Per-customer churn probabilities

Example performance

ROC AUC ≈ 0.84

PR AUC ≈ 0.64

Optimized threshold ≈ 0.57

Design Decisions & Tradeoffs
Warehouse-first transformations: All feature engineering and aggregations live in Snowflake views to ensure consistency between ML and BI.
Logistic Regression over black-box models: Chosen for interpretability and stable probability calibration in churn use cases.
Latest-run isolation: BI views are scoped to the most recent model run to prevent stale scores from leaking into dashboards.

How to Run Locally (No Secrets Exposed)
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snowflake-churn-warehouse.git
cd snowflake-churn-warehouse
2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows Git Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure environment variables
Secrets are never committed.

cp .env.example .env
Fill in your Snowflake credentials inside .env.

.env is excluded via .gitignore.

4. Run local profiling (DuckDB)
python run_local_duckdb.py
Validates:

delimiter detection

numeric parsing

churn distribution

feature logic

5. Load data into Snowflake
python -m src.load_to_snowflake
Creates:

RAW → STG → ANALYTICS schemas

Feature mart

6. Run warehouse-native quality checks
python -m src.run_quality_checks
Includes:

uniqueness checks

null checks

label distribution

parsing health

7. Train model and write scores
python -m src.model_train_score
Outputs:

MODEL\_RUNS

CUSTOMER\_CHURN\_SCORES

8. Open Power BI
Connect to Snowflake

Import BI views

Load dashboard (.pbix)

Future Enhancements
Add incremental scoring using Snowflake Tasks and Streams
Introduce feature monitoring and data drift detection
Deploy Power BI dashboards via scheduled refresh and role-based access
Security Notes
No credentials in source code

.env file is gitignored
